* Airlines Reservation System in C++ with MySQL

## Class db_response
This class contains connection of the database.mysql_init is the initializer of mysql_real_connect mysql_real_connect connects to the database. (MySql server should open while connecting) the if statement shows the successful or failed connection.

## Function main
Here firstly the clear screen command then the title command and the color command. db_response::ConnectionFunction() is create the connection to the database.
The program features
* Reserve Seat.
* User Ticket.
* Flights Schedule.
* Display Passenger.
* Flight Details.
* Add Flight.
* Edit Flight.
* Delete Flight.
* Flight Leave And Arrive.
* Back To Menu.
* The switch case is used for switching between this functions
* ReserveSeat();
* UserTicket();
* FlightSchedule();
* DisplayPassenger();
* FlightDetails();
* AddNewFlight();
* EditFlight();
* DeleteFlight();
* FlightLeaveArrive();

## Function ReserveSeat
User can reserve seat for passenger. Some user details need to fill up then the data of the user stored in the database with “Insert” query. Finally success message ensures the data added in the database or the failed message show the error code. Now the Exit Code runs and ask the user for go to menu or Reserve seat again.

## Function UserTicket

* Add Flight, Edit Flight, Delete Flight, Flight Leave And Arrive and Back to Menu
This options are for manipulate the flight detail in C++ program

## Function AddNewFlight
Here firstly the program get all the flight information from user Then the information insert into the database with “Insert” query
If the operation successfully done then the program shows the Success message or found any error then the program show error message with error code Finally the Exit Code runs and ask the user to go to main menu, insert again or exit from C++ program
*  Function EditFlight

If the ID found by the program then it shows the row of the corresponding id and ask for change the values that the user want if the user don’t want to change any value then they can simply type ”X”. Now the “Update” query runs and if no exception found the console shows the success message now the Exit Code runs and ask for the user to choose go to menu, edit another item or exit from the C++ program.

## Function DeleteFlight
